# Lyrics of all the music that I have no plans recording
  - ## May 2022
    - ### to speak of colours
      ###### If you said the words
      ###### As it came of a drawing
      ###### I would know you mean it
      ###### If you think of me
      ###### As you speak about her
      ###### No, that won't happen
      ###### It just won't
      ###### If you only knew
      ###### I think you already do
      ###### Of this little thing I call little just no not accept it
      ###### Oh well I do
      ###### I don't even know what I'm talking about now
      ###### I just feel like I need to tell you some things
      ###### But I don't have them in mind, yet
      ###### I'm not sure I ever will
    - ### blinded of time
    - ### this maybe is
    - ### litterfall
    - ### you were a dream (I don't know what we are, I don't know what we'll be)
    - ### soon you won't be
    - ### A stands for you
    - ### how time seemed
